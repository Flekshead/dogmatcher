    <h3>LISTS OF POTENTIAL BREEDS</h3>
    <section class="container-fluid justified width-var">Below are two lists of dog breeds - the primary list more closely matches your personality and the secondary
        list expands slightly to give you a few more options (the primary list may be empty, but no need to fret). These lists are only to give you a starting point - they are
        based on generalizations of breeds and it is imperative to remember that there will be a variety of personalities within a litter, let alone across an entire breed.
        Additionally, there are several mixed breed dogs that may fit your lifestyle as well. Whichever way you choose, ensure that you have adequate time to get to know
        the dog in person before making any final decisions.
